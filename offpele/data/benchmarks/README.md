# Benchmarks
Datasets to be used in benchmarking studies for offpele.

## Content
_Content under construction_
- GPCRs (5c1m, 6dde, and crossPELE)
- PPIs (6y8H, 4ipf)
- PlopLigands (Ligands to parametrize with offpele and OPLS2005) 
- Small molecule set with experimental hydration free energies (Need to search)

## Analysis features
_Content under construction_


- Rotamer library comparison between offpele and PlopRotTemp
- Experimental hydration free energies comparison _(inside the PELE-platform)_
- Comparison of parameters between offpele and PlopRotTemp (bonds, angles, dihedrals, nonbonding and OBC)
- Structural comparison between PELE's OPLS and OFF implementations
- Energetic profile comparison in gold-standard systems (previously published)
